# FactIsFact

This gem returns a fact about any number provided. It is useful when you want
some random trivia or facts to be displayed about a number, on your website.

P.S: Gem internally uses http://numbersapi.com/ to return the results.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fact_is_fact'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fact_is_fact

## Usage
* `type` is one of `trivia`, `math`, `date`, or `year`. Defaults to `trivia` if omitted.
* `number` is
    * an `integer`, or
    * the keyword `random`, for which we will try to return a random available fact, or
    * a `day` of year in the form `month/day` (eg. 2/29, 1/09, 04/1), if `type` is `date`

basic examples
```ruby
# math fact
FactIsFact.return(type: 'math', number: '1234')
#=> "1234 is the smallest 4-digit number with increasing digits."

# date fact
FactIsFact.return(type: 'date', number: '2/29')
#=> "February 29th is the day in 1892 that St. Petersburg, Florida is incorporated."

# year fact
FactIsFact.return(type: 'year', number: '1234')
#=> "1234 is the year that the Manden region raises against the Kaniaga kingdom."

# trivia
FactIsFact.return(type: 'trivia', number: 'random')
#=> "150000000 is the number of items held in the British Library."
```

## Optional parameters

### Result in JSON format
Include the query parameter `json` or set the HTTP header `Content-Type` to `application/json` to return the fact and associated meta-data as a JSON object

```ruby
FactIsFact.return(type: 'math', number: '123', json: '')
#=> "{\n \"text\": \"123 is the 10^{th} Lucas number.\",\n \"number\": 123,\n \"found\": true,\n \"type\": \"math\"\n}"

FactIsFact.return(type: 'trivia', number: 'random', json: true)
#=> "{\n \"text\": \"88 is the number of keys on a piano (36 black and 52 white).\",\n \"number\": 88,\n \"found\": true,\n \"type\": \"trivia\"\n}"

FactIsFact.return(type: 'math', number: '12', json: nil)
#=> "{\n \"text\": \"12 is a superfactorial, being the product of the first three factorials.\",\n \"number\": 12,\n \"found\": true,\n \"type\": \"math\"\n}"
```
**Note**: you can pass any value to `json`, as long as the parameter is present, it does not matter what the value of the `json` parameter is.

### FRAGMENT
Return the fact as a sentence fragment that can be easily included as part of a larger sentence. This means that the first word is lowercase and ending punctuation is omitted. For trivia and math, a noun phrase is returned that can be used in a sentence like "We now have more users than [fact as fragment]!".

```ruby
FactIsFact.return(type: 'math', number: '13', fragment: '')
#=> "the number of Archimedian solids"

FactIsFact.return(type: 'math', number: '139', fragment: nil)
#=> "the number of unlabeled topologies with 5 elements"

FactIsFact.return(type: 'year', number: '1920', fragment: true)
#=> "the United States Congress refuses to ratify the Treaty of Versailles"
```
**Note**: you can pass any value to `fragment`, as long as the parameter is present, it does not matter what the value of the `fragment` parameter is.

### Not Found
The `notfound` field tells us what to do if the number is not found. You can give us

* `floor` to round down to the largest number that does have an associated fact, and return that fact.
```ruby
FactIsFact.return(type: 'math', number: '123123123', notfound: 'floor')
#=> "12988816 is the number of domino tilings of an 8\xC3\x978 checkerboard."
```

* `ceil`, which is like `floor` but rounds up to the smallest number that has an associated fact.
```ruby
FactIsFact.return(type: 'math', number: '123123123', notfound: 'ceil')
#=> "215000000 is the number of mathematical constants are collected on the Plouffe's Inverter as of 2010."
```

### Default message (if notfound)

* `default` to return one of our pre-written missing messages, or a message you supply with the default query field. This is the default behaviour.

```ruby
FactIsFact.return(type: 'math', number: '123123123', default: 'no facts found')
#=> "no facts found"
```

## MIN AND MAX
Restrict the range of values returned to the inclusive range [min, max] when random is given as the number.

```ruby
FactIsFact.return(type: 'trivia', number: 'random', min: 10, max: 20)
#=> "16 is the number of personality types in the Myers-Briggs classification system."
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
